## Repository directory
* Client: contains the entire front-end of the project. Developed with create-react-app
* Server: contains all the back-end of the project. Developed with Node JS, Express and MongoDB.

## How to see the project?
* You can see the project online here: https://dazzling-wing-6d1faa.netlify.app/ go, and create your account!
* Or, you can run it locally:

Download the project code (git clone)
Go to the client folder (cd client) and run `yarn install` to install all the development dependencies
Go to the server folder (cd server) and run `yarn install` to install all development dependencies

Finally you can build the local project in two ways:

1. Inside the client folder you can run: `yarn start`, which will bring up the front-end of the project with react on localhost: 3000. Then, go to the server folder and with a new terminal run: `yarn start` or` yarn run start` and the back-end would already be running on port 5050.

2. Go to the main directory, that is, in */chat-simancas* and run: `yarn install` and then run` yarn dev` this will lift both the front-end and the back-end on the aforementioned ports using **concurrently**.
